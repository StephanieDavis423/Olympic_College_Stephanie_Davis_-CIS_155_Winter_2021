        Since this is the first draft, everything here is what has been added so far. Though I am not quite sure if I am doing everything correctly, I am enjoying working on this. The module 1 instructions are very clear, but I do't really understand the module 2 intrustions have me baffled and I don't know what they are asking so I kind of just starting working on the style and layout of how I want the site to look.
